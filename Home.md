Welcome to the Coinffeine wiki!

### What is Coinffeine?

Coinffeine is an open source, peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange platform. With Coinffeine you are able to buy and sell bitcoins securely and anonymously without having to rely on a centralized exchange like MtGox or Bitstamp. It's like BitTorrent for your bitcoins!

### How does it work?

Coinffeine solves two hard, unrelated problems in order to enable the P2P exchange:

- [[Distributed broker]] that pairs ASKs and BIDs
- [[Zero trust exchange algorithm]] that provides a secure way of exchanging bitcoins with EUR/USD/JPY/etc with an internet stranger

### How can I contribute?

Spread the word about the project by telling your friends! The exchange platform will only get better as we keep adding new users.

If you want to take a more active role, we also welcome any kind of contributions. We are happy to receive suggestions, bug reports, pull requests... anything that improves the project.

The project is mainly written in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/). We use [Akka](http://akka.io/) to handle concurrency and [BitcoinJ](https://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/) to work with bitcoin.

If you want to start developing, take a look at the [[Dev Getting Started]] page.
