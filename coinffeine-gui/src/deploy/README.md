**For Windows 8 users**. There is a known bug in JDK 8 that prevents 
msvcp100.dll library to be included in the bundle. Nevertheless, this library
is required by the Java runtime, so the app will fail if such library is not
included in the bundle. 

This bug is known and will be fixed in JDK 8u40, which will be relased in
March 2015. Until then, the Inno Setup config file includes msvcp100.dll
by following these steps.

* Install MSVC 2010 Redistributable package in the system. You may obtain it 
from http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/confirmation.aspx?id=14632
* Copy the library from `C:\Windows\System32\msvcp100.dll` into 
`C:\Windows\Temp`. This step is needed because Inno Setup is unable to access
`C:\Windows\System32\msvcp100.dll` for some unknown reason. 
* Execute `sbt gui/package-javafx` normally to have a valid Windows installer.
